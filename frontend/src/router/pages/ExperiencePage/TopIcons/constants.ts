export const PROFILE_TEXT = `I am a frontend engineer with over 4 years of commercial experience. I began my programming journey at university. While
working on a mobile robot control project with a web-based user interface, I discovered a passion for frontend development. Over
time, I specialized in web technologies, particularly HTML, CSS, TypeScript, React.js and many other related technologies.
In my professional career, I have contributed to the development of modern web applications with a focus on performance,
responsiveness, and clean architecture. I enjoy working collaboratively in teams and take pride in delivering high-quality technical
solutions. Currently, I am seeking new challenges that will allow me to grow further in web development.`
